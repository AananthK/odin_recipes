        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>

        <p id="intro"> Welcome to my first website! This website was designed during my 
            progression through the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/" target ="blank">Odin Project</a> Foundations course.
            This site was made to implement basic HTML and CSS components that were taught throughout the course.
            Here you can find recipies I found online at <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/" target ="blank">Allrecipies</a>.
